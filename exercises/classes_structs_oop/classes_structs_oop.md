# Participation: Classes, Structs, and OOP

## Goal

To mess around with variables and get more comfortable with the basics.

## Instructions

Ok. First off, make a new repo for this exercise. After all, we want to keep good practice and make sure our work is preserved in version history. Once that is set up, we should go ahead and make a visual studio project and save it inside that repo folder. It will be another simple console exercise. So just make a new console project. But remember, from now on we are going to use the more modern .NET 8.0 framework. So, select the regular "Console App" as highlighted below.

Awesome work! 

## Reference

If you want reference to the full script, then you can find it here:

```C#
namespace ConsoleApp
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

At this point we have successfully tinkered around with some of the topics we have talked about in class.

We now have some hands on experience with:

- working with various datatypes
- working with variables
- declaring and initalizing variables
- printing to the console
- concatenating strings
- concatenating strings in a console print to make more advanced console logs
- used the increment operator for the first time
- making a goofy console adventure story via programming
