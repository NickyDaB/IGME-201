# Participation: File IO

## Goal  
Get some first hand experience with file IO:
- Navigating directories.
- Checking if files and folders exist.
- Creating and deleting files and folders.
- Writing to a file
- Reading from a file

## Objective
Follow a guided tutorial to gain some experience. This will help prepare us for more open ended assignments and challenges in the future. By gaining a little experience here and there in small bursts, we hope that future assignments won't be as scary and new! :)

## Task:  
Follow this step by step guide.

## Instructions
Let's start off by creating a new repo, a new console app, and getting everything set up as we usually do.

I'll name my project `practicing-file-io`.
