# Participation: Logic and Loops

## Goal

To get some practice with more open ended instructions and tasks as we might see in the work force given to us by a team lead or manager while also practicing new skills and knowledge such as file IO.

## Instructions

### Totally Important Backstory

Programmers and coders on Jupiter's moon of Input/Output, **IO**, have a long-running tradition that was destroyed when the Uncoded Forgotton One, **UFO**, arrived. The great coders of Io would compete over a long period of time to see who could press the most keys on the keyboard. But the UFO’s arrival destroyed the moon people’s ability to use the Medallion of Files, and the historic competitions spanning days, weeks, and months have become impossible. As a True Programmer, you can use the Medallion of Files to bring back these long-running games to the moon.

### Objectives

"your mission, should you choose to accept it" - Mission Impossible Force 

#### Open ended objectives to accomplish using all the knowledge and skills you have gained so far in this course:
- When the program starts, ask the user to enter their name.
- By default, the player starts with a score of 0.
- Add 1 point to their score for every keypress they make.
- Display the player’s updated score after each keypress.
- When the player presses the Enter key, end the game. 
  - **Hint:** the following code reads a keypress and checks whether it was the Enter key: `Console.ReadKey().Key == ConsoleKey.Enter`
- When the player presses Enter, save their score in a file. 
  - **Hint:** Consider saving this to a file named `[username].txt`. For this challenge, you can assume the user doesn’t enter a name that would produce an illegal file name (such as `*`).
- When a user enters a name at the start, if they already have a previously saved score, start with that score instead.

Good Luck :)

## Conclusion

At this point, consider yourself a master! You were able to complete your mission given the super vauge instructions of "do the thing!". 

We now have some more experience with:

- File IO
- Dealing with a combination of open-ended project goals with slight constraints given to us by a team lead

Gain 100 XP! 

Level Up!

## Bonus Levels: Where can we go from here?

Are you taking this class on an "Advanced Difficultly"? 

For the programmers:
- Try swapping out the multiple files per user format to a single file that uses JSON format. 

For the designers:
- Try making a more interesting and in depth experience than just "smash the keyboard". Maybe make a word matching typing game? Where a user needs to type a specific full word to get a "point". For example have you heard of super fun typing games like [Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYOuNhT61D8) or [Icarus Proudbottom Teaches Typing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI17-9wAEMQ) by one of my favorite Brooklyn, NY indie studios [Holy Wow Studios](https://www.holywowstudios.com/)?

These challenge mode tasks won't give you more points toward your grade, but you can brag about it in Slack if you figure it out and want to show off to your peers!
